### Number of job seekers in Karawang district according to education level in 2020

This dataset was produced by the Karawang Regency Manpower and Transmigration Service and published within a period of 1 year. This data can provide an overview of the distribution of registered job seekers based on education level in Karawang Regency and its changes in recent years.

### The visualization results are as follows:
‚Ä¢ Based on the diagram above, it can be seen that job seekers are based on education level, namely from a total of 42,125 applicants in 2020. The highest level is at the high school level at 90.33% (38,051 applicants). Then in second place is at the junior high school level at 3.47% (1,460 applicants ). Overall, the job market in Indonesia continues to grow, offering various growth opportunities for job seekers from various educational backgrounds. By analyzing the data provided by the dashboard, recruiters can identify talent potential and industry trends, thereby ensuring a more effective and efficient recruitment process.

‚Ä¢ Based on the data above, it can be seen that the highest number of job seekers in the January-May period were job seekers at the high school education level with a percentage of 16.2% (6,862 applicants), and the lowest number of job seekers were at the Bachelor level with a percentage of 0.06 % (26 applicants) of a total of 42,125 applicants in 2020.

‚Ä¢ Based on the visualization above, it can be concluded that the highest percentage of job seekers are high school graduates at 90.3%. This is because the number of high school graduates is usually greater than the number of bachelor's, diploma, elementary school graduates and junior high school graduates. So competition for jobs is getting tougher for high school graduates. With 3.5% of junior high school graduates and 1.5% of elementary school graduates, this causes their skills and knowledge to be more limited than graduates of other levels of higher education. For Bachelor graduates 3.3% and for Diploma graduates 1.4%. Job search rates are often tied to the health of a region's economy. Karawang Regency experienced a decline in economic activity or slowing growth in 2020, this has an impact on opening up job opportunities for Bachelor and Diploma graduates. In addition, the economic crisis in 2020 due to external factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic could have a significant impact on the labor market.

‚Ä¢ Based on the results of the diagram above, it can be seen that the highest average job seeker in 2020 was at the high school education level, namely 38,051 (90.3%) of the total average of all job seekers in 2020. Then in second place was the education level SMP, namely 1,460 (3.41%).
